I am a full-stack development bootacamp student. I've learned a lot in a very short period of time. 
The instructors are always helpful and encouraging. The lessons are highly challenging but doable.
The experience has been forcing me to be on task and develop a skill to to get into a great habit of problem solver and team player. 
I am so looking forward to have completed the program and be fully confident when I'm done to enter the technical field as a software 
developer.
